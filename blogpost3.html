          <h2>Sedgeford Hall Portrait</h2>
          <p>The "Sedgeford Hall Portrait" (location: King's Lynn Town Hall, Norfolk, UK), is an oil on canvas portrait in the American School by an unknown artist circa 1830. It depicts Pe-o-ka, wife of the Seminole chief, Osceola, and their son. It was once believed by many to be a portrait painted from life of Pocahontas and her son, Thomas Rolfe.</p>
          <br/>
          <h3>Provenance and identification</h3>
          <p>Eustace Neville Rolfe of Heacham Hall in Norfolk, a possible distant relative of Thomas, acquired the painting, believing it to be of Pocahontas and Thomas. At some point it was hung in a Rolfe family estate building called Sedgeford Hall (Norfolk, England), from whence it acquired its name. Art experts later disputed the painting's origin, saying it could not have been painted during the lifetime of Pocahontas. Additionally, the child in the portrait appears to be several years older than Thomas Rolfe would have been when his mother was still alive. Thomas Rolfe was born in January 1615, making him two years, two months old at the time of Pocahontas's death.

                In 2010, researcher Bill Ryan, while reviewing magazine archives on the Seminole Indians, found a black-and-white drawn version of the painting in the 1848 edition of Illustrated London News identifying the portrait as "the wife and child of Osceola, the last of the Seminole Indian chiefs." Osceola himself was of mixed race (Creek Indian and English), which explains the European features of the child. The portrait is now generally accepted as being his wife and son, though some questions still remain. Many printed and Internet sources, however, still refer to this painting as a portrait of Pocahontas and Thomas Rolfe.
