            Eagle Creek is an Emerson International development designed by Ron Garl and Howard Swan. The course opened for business in May 2004. Eagle Creek Golf Club was the first golf course in Florida to use Mini Verde Grass on its greens, and the first course in central Florida to offer PrecedentGolf Cars made by Club Car. In October 2004, Eagle Creek became home to Graves Golf Academy.
