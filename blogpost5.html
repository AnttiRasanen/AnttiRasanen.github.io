          <h2>Rhema Media</h2>
          <p>Rhema Media (previously known as Rhema Broadcasting Group or RBG) is a Christian media organisation in New Zealand. It owns radio networks Rhema, Life FM and Star, and television station Shine TV. It also publishes Bob Gass's quarterly devotional publication The Word For Today, and a youth version called The Word For You Today. Rhema Media is based in Newton, Auckland and is the founding organisation of United Christian Broadcasters (UCB).</p>
          <p>Rhema Media was set up in the 1960s by Christchurch evangelical Richard Berry, following the success of Ecudorian Christian short-wave radio station HCJB. The company's flagship network Rhema (then New Zealand's Rhema) began full-time broadcasting on 11 November 1978. In 1997 the company launched the additional radio brands of Life FM and Star (then Southern Star). Shine TV was launched in 2002, and The Word radio network operated between 2007 and 2015.</p>
