          <h2>2002–03 New York Knicks season</h2>
          <p>
                The 2002–03 New York Knicks season was the 57th season for the Knicks in the National Basketball Association. After missing the playoffs for the first time in 15 years, the Knicks' hopes for a rebound season took a hit before the start of the season as Antonio McDyess, who was acquired from the Denver Nuggets during the offseason, needed knee surgery and was lost for the entire season. Meanwhile, Latrell Sprewell showed up to training camp with a broken hand, and was fined $250,000. In Don Chaney's first full season as head coach, the Knicks lost ten of their first twelve games and missed the NBA Playoffs for the second straight year, finishing tied for fifth in the Atlantic Division with a 37–45 record, which was a 7-game improvement over their previous season. Following the season, Sprewell was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.
          </p>

                On February 4, 2003, in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Sprewell scored 38 points and made each of his nine three-point field goal attempts. His performance set an NBA single-game record for the most three-pointers made without missing a three-point attempt.
